---------------------------------------

## Introduction ##

As a little kid I always wanted to figure out how things worked. 
Taking everything apart, only to have to call for my brother to help me put it back together.
This changed over my life into designing things myself digitally.
I am interested in software, security and developing systems, while keeping things practical.
Beside the love for software development I like to mentor or teach people, and be someone people can easily approach for help.
